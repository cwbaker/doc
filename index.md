*Doc* is a theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) providing simple styling and navigation for documentation hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  It is based on [Hyde](https://hyde.getpoole.com/) with a lot of inspiration from [Alabaster](https://alabaster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and a table of contents straight out of [Just the Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs).

## Usage

Use Doc as a remote theme by adding the following to `_config.yaml` for your Jekyll site:

~~~yaml
remote_theme: cwbaker/doc
~~~
